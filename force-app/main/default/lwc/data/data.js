        "description_work": "My name is Yoonsuk Chang. I am currently working as a Salesforce developer at i2MAX in South Korea. Since I joined, I have done several tasks: (1) monitoring errors and making reports daily, (2) developing Salesforce interfaces, and (3) package development. For teamwork, I usually use Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Gather Town. And I also got three certifications: Salesforce Administrator, Advanced Administrator, and Platform Developer I.",
        "description_me": "You may be wondering who I am. I was born in Seoul, South Korea and got a master's degree in International Crime in New York, the U.S.. I initially looked for an opportunity in the criminal justice field. However, things did not go as planned due to the pandemic. I came back to Korea and wanted to find an opportunity in a different field that allows me to work regardless of my location and the pandemic. I remembered that I had taken Cybercrime and Cyber Investigation classes in graduate school and had enjoyed them a lot. So, I decided to go into the IT field to find a better opportunity, which was a bit risky for me to change my life path given that I studied criminal justice for many years.",
        "description_me_second": "After completing a programming bootcamp, I looked for a job as a React developer or a Java developer. But I came across a job opening for a Salesforce developer. I got so curious about Salesforce. Until then I did not know about Salesforce, and I noticed that lots of people talked about how great Salesforce is. So, I took a look at it and found out that not only does it have a huge ecosystem, but it also provides well-organized learning materials for everyone for free. I felt that it was where I should go for.",
